      <description>100 Days to Offload and Starting Over Starting Over Seems like every few years I get the itch to actually do something with this website that I&amp;rsquo;ve owned for many years. I&amp;rsquo;m not a great writer and don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very interesting. I definitely have not been very consistent when it comes to writing a blog. So why am I doing this now?
Well it came about with my renewed interest in using Mastodon shortly after the twitter takeover.</description>
