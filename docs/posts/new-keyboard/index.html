                    <p>I decided to treat myself to a new mechanical keyboard.  I spend a lot of time on my computer working from home and over the last several years I&rsquo;ve been slowly upgrading my home setup.  While my previous Corsair k55 has held up well, I have been eyeing a the daskeyboard line for several years now and was looking for something a little more satisfying to use in my current setup.</p>
<p><img src="/img/DasKeyboard6Pro.jpg#Center" alt="DasKeyboard6"></p>
<p>I settled on the <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-6-professional/">daskeyboard 6 professional</a> with the cherry mx blue keys.  While this is probably the most I&rsquo;ve ever spent on a keyboard, one week in I am not regretting it.  The key action while typing is smooth and the cherry blues have a satisfying click that&rsquo;s sure to annoy anyone in the same room as you.  The full-NKRO is super nice and I have not had any issues when typing fast.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago I switched my desktop over to Fedora Workstation 37 from windowws 10 and I was happy to see that the keyboard just works right out of the box.  This includes the media keys, volume knob and sleep button.  I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to try out the built in usb c hub just yet but this was another bonus to me.  This desktop doesn&rsquo;t have any usb c ports and I am hoping this will work with some usb c Yubikeys.</p>
<p>If you are going to spend a third of your life on a PC it makes sense to invest in quality hardware that you enjoy using.  And with a rating of 50 million keystrokes, hopefully this will last me many many years.  If only it made me a better speller.</p>
