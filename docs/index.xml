      <description>I decided to treat myself to a new mechanical keyboard. I spend a lot of time on my computer working from home and over the last several years I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly upgrading my home setup. While my previous Corsair k55 has held up well, I have been eyeing a the daskeyboard line for several years now and was looking for something a little more satisfying to use in my current setup.</description>

      <description>100 Days to Offload and Starting Over Starting Over Seems like every few years I get the itch to actually do something with this website that I&amp;rsquo;ve owned for many years. I&amp;rsquo;m not a great writer and don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself very interesting. I definitely have not been very consistent when it comes to writing a blog. So why am I doing this now?
Well it came about with my renewed interest in using Mastodon shortly after the twitter takeover.</description>
