      <description>Starting Over I&amp;rsquo;ve made many attempts at keeping and maintaining a blog but it normally doesn&amp;rsquo;t last very long. All previous iterations of this site have been wordpress, either hosted by some place like GoDaddy, a &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; in my house, or on a VPS in the cloud. I think one of the bigger challenges with doing that is the overhead of maintaining Wordpress and keeping everything up to date. This time I&amp;rsquo;m trying something different to keep things simple while still challenging myself to learn something new and relevant to what I do.</description>
